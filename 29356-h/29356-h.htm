<p class="pr1"><big><b>Henderson's lovely flowers were going to bring
him fame&mdash;until they walked and talked too much.</b></big></p></div>

<p class="cap"><span class="smcap">The ringing</span> of the door bell
cut into Henderson's concentration
and he made a gesture of
irritation with one outflung hand.
But he didn't raise his head or
shift his eyes one iota from the
tiny green thing on his laboratory
table. Tensely absorbed, he stood
watching the small miracle he had
made and emotion approaching
exultation gripped him.</p>

<p>He slid one hand toward a
switch, never moving his eyes
from the table. The infinitesimal
movement of his hand increased
the power throb in the machine at
his side so imperceptibly that only
he could be aware of it.</p>

<p>Suddenly his breath exploded
in what was almost a squeal of
delight.</p>

<p>The small green plant on the
table was with great effort extending
a pair of tiny rootlets and
was trying to use them to walk!</p>

<p>As Henderson watched, spellbound,
the sudden cessation of the
doorbell's ring went unnoticed.
He stood there, willing with every
cell of his body the miracle that
would make that small shred of
green take the first vital step.</p>

<p>Slowly, slowly it struggled to
an upright position, stood wavering.
Henderson increased the
power with a trembling hand and
almost forgot to breathe as he
waited for the miracle which followed.</p>

<p>Several more rootlets abruptly
appeared, and now the plant balanced
itself easily on the bare
table. Then slowly, as a long
minute passed, one of the roots
made an uncertain step, then
another and another, until it was
walking unsteadily across the surface
of the table!</p>

<p>Henderson, his face&mdash;even his
lips&mdash;white with excitement, now
reached for another switch. Before
turning it on he adjusted a
tiny microphone on the edge of
the table. Then he turned the
screw switch ...</p>

<p>Instantaneously the laboratory
was filled with a rustling. Then
there came a series of tiny squeaks
that sounded strangely like a voice
speaking. Henderson sat spellbound,
watching, listening ...</p>

<p>The door bell rang again, but
this time he didn't even hear it.
Nothing could break the spell
which held him in his seat before
the first talking and walking plant
the world had ever known.</p>

<p>He picked up an alternate
phase microphone and spoke into
it. His voice issued from a tiny
speaker beside the plant as a
small whisper of itself.</p>

<p>"Man!" his voice whispered,
"Man!" He nearly yelled his delight
as the small green thing
echoed the word!</p>

<p>He shut off the mike, then, and
got busy. He sat down and began
to plan a vocabulary to educate
his plant. When that was done he
would stun the world with a
demonstration of his genius ...</p>

<p>It was some time before he
realized there was a ghost of a
voice coming from someplace in
the room. He looked at the plant
on the table, but it was standing
quiescent.</p>

<p>Henderson stared around the
laboratory, frowning. Then a
movement at the window caught
his eye.</p>

<p>His mother's prize geranium
was struggling to free itself from
the soil in the window box! And
it was muttering! Henderson
blushed as he made out some of
the words the flower was muttering.
That plant had been in the
room with him during some of his
most dismal scientific failures, and
it evidently had a good memory.
He watched wild-eyed as the plant
struggled to lift its roots from the
earth ...</p>

<p>One root finally came loose
with an audible <span class="smcapl">POP</span>, accompanied
by a squeaking streak of profanity.
Another and another root
worked free, and suddenly the
geranium was standing on the
edge of the box. Its bright red
blossom turned from side to side.
There were no eyes visible but
Henderson had the chilly feeling
that the flower was surveying the
room. Then, after a moment, the
plant jumped to the sill of the
window, from there to the seat
of a chair. Then it slid down one
of the legs of the chair to the
floor.</p>

<p>It shook its leaves, lifted its
blossom upward at the amazed
Henderson frozen in his chair,
and the tiny squeaking voice said
cheerily, "Hi, Pal!" Then it started
walking across the floor, toward
the door, muttering, "Somebody's
got to answer that damned door
bell."</p>

<p>Henderson's legs came unfroze
as it went through the doorway
and he made a wild dash after
the walking geranium. It was
padding down the hall, its roots
making little patting sounds on
the linoleum as he passed it.</p>

<p>Henderson opened the door,
and only then did he begin to
realize the scope his rays must
have!</p>

<p>He stood, jaws agape, looking
down at the rose-bush which
stood outside the door. His mouth
opened and words tried to come
out. But the bush spoke first.</p>

<p>"I've been ringing this bell for
hours," it said petulantly. "Some
nasty boys have been picking my
roses and I'm getting sore!"</p>

<p>Henderson fainted then, and
the last thing he remembered was
the voice of the geranium saying:</p>

<p>"Hi, Babe, come on in. I been
watching <i>you</i> for a long time!"</p>
